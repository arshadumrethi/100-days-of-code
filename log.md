The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on [22 October, Monday, 2018].

## Log

### R1 Day 1 
Worked on the JS for Compound Interest Calculator. A slightly older project of mine that needs to be completed.

Also it helps practice DOM manipulation and some other features I'm trying to incorporate.

Challenges encountered:
