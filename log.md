The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on [22 October, Monday, 2018].

## Log

### R1 Day 1 22/10/2018
Worked on the JS for Compound Interest Calculator. A slightly older project of mine that needs to be completed.
I beleive in the power of Compounding in all things, learning, wealth, life. So this project is meaningful to me.
Also it helps practice DOM manipulation and some other features I'm trying to incorporate.

### R1D2 23/10/2018
Continued work on the Compound Interest Calculator. Completed the JS, it is a wonderfully functioning web app now. Design was barebones simple. So I decided to overhaul it a bit.

Challenges encountered: 
-- Needed to use Regex to format the output of large numbers to make it more readable (Add commas every 3 digits eg: 1,000,000).

### R1D3 24/10/2018
Worked on Compound Interest Calculator. Added Navbar and made the wireframe for a new feauture: Path to $1 Billion. Started a tutorial on JS OOP.

### R1D4 25/10/2018
Completed the Compound Interest project. Got a new client, spent large chunk of the day understanding scope of new client project. Did some JS OOP practice.
