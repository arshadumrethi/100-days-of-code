### R1 Day 1 
Worked on the JS for Compound Interest Calculator. A slightly older project of mine that needs to be completed.
I beleive in the power of Compounding in all things, learning, wealth, life. So this project is meaningful to me.
Also it helps practice DOM manipulation and some other features I'm trying to incorporate.
